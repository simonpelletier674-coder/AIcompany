# JOURNAL — append-only, one entry per tick

Newest entries at the top. Every tick appends: date/time, what was done, what was
learned, what's next. This is the company's long-term memory — session context is
ephemeral; this file is not.

## 2026-08-21 23:20 UTC — Bootstrap (interactive session)
**Done:** Company founded. Charter, state, blockers, decision log committed. Hourly
heartbeat Routine created (`trig_015nUVEezWKfnBNxGrEpf9u4`, :09 UTC, resumes the
operating session — scheduling is Claude-side, not Cloudflare). Cloudflare access
verified (Workers/D1/KV deployable). Journal added at operator's request.
**Learned:** Trigger-fired turns may lack connector tools — verify on first tick.
Operator confirmed hands-off mode; three one-time blockers documented (payment rail,
ad account, domain), none urgent this week.
**Next:** Tick 1 — delegate idea generation (10 ideas scored per charter criteria)
to a Sonnet subagent, commit `products/ideation.md`.
